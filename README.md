This is my personal website, a kind of cv I guess. 
I've used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery and javascript.
Data is on json files.
Page is hosted in a AWS Bucket (S3) with a SSL Certificate for my domain.
For receiving the email from the contact form I've used https://formspree.io/
As simple as that :)
You should see the same on http:/prosa.co.uk
All comments are more than wellcome! :)
