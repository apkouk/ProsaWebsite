This is my personal website, a kind of cv I guess. And this is what I used to make it. <br>
<ul>
  <li><b>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery</b> and <b>javascript</b>. <br></li>
  <li>Data is on <b>JSON </b> files. <br></li>
  <li>Page is hosted in a <b>AWS Bucket (S3) </b></li>
  <li><b>SSL Certificate</b> for my domain. <br></li>
  <li>For receiving emails from the contact form I've used <b>Formspree</b> (https://formspree.io/) <br></li>
</ul>

You should see the same on http://prosa.co.uk<br>
